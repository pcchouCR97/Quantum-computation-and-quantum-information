# Qiskit
[Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) is IBM’s quantum framework. It relies on Python as a host language and provides a wide range of simulators as well as allowing the submission of algorithms to IBM’s real quantum hardware

# PennyLane 
[PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) is a quantum framework built specifically for quantum machine learning, but it can perfectly be used as a general-purpose quantum computing framework. It is quite a newcomer to the quantum programming scene and it is being developed at Xanadu.

# Ocean
[Ocean](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/) is a Python library developed by the Canadian company D-Wave. In contrast with the other software packages that we have mentioned so far, Ocean’s goal is not the implementation and execution of quantum circuits. Instead, this library allows you to define instances of combinatorial optimization problems of different types and to solve them both with classical algorithms and on D-Wave’s quantum annealers (special quantum computers that are not general-purpose but oriented to solving optimization problems).
