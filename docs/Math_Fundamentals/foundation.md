# Sets

## Definition
A *set* is a *collection of objects*. This collection can be ifinte or inifinte. Mathematical objects are abstract, have properties, and can be acted upon by operations.

### Set-builder notation


### Other set notation 
An important symbol in set notation is $\in$, which denotes membership. And $\notin$ means the object is not a member of the set.

The next symbol to consider is used to denote subsets. If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, and every element of $X$ is also an element of $Y$, then:

*   $X$ is a **subset** of $Y$, denoted by $X \subseteq Y$
*   $Y$ is a **superset** of $X$, denoted by $Y \supseteq X$

##  Important sets of numbers

*   $\mathbb{N}$, which is the set of natural numbers defined as {0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦}. This is the first set of numbers you learn as a child, and they are used for counting.
*   $\mathbb{Z}$,
*   $\mathbb{Q}$,
*   $\mathbb{R}$,
*   $\mathbb{C}$,
