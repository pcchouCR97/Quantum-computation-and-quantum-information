Recall that the a complex number $z$ can be written in polar coordinates as:
$$
z = re^{i\alpha}
$$
where $r = |z|$ is a non-negative real number and $\alpha$ is an angle in $[0, 2\pi]$. consider, then a qubit in a state $\lvert\psi\rangle = a\lvert0\rangle + b\lvert1\rangle$ and write $a$ and $b$ in polar coordinates as:
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
a = r_{1}e^{i\alpha_{1}} &, & b = r_{2}e^{i\alpha_{2}}
\end{array}
$$
we also know that $r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}=|a^{1}|+|b^{1}|=1 and, since $0\leq r_{1}, r{2}\leq 1$, there must exist a angle $\theta$ in $[0, \pi]$ such that $\text{cos}(\theta/2) = r_{1}$ and $\text{cos}(\theta/2) = r_{2}$
