# Welcome to Quantum Optimization and Machine Learning

This is a collection of my learnings and projects on quantum optimization and machine learning. You can start _(Optimization)_ from here and _(Machine Learning)_ from here. But don't worry, I also provide a overview and practical implementation of the classical optimization and machine learning methodoloies. 

# Quick Guide
1. If you are familiar with classical optimization methods, you can start quantum world with 
2. If you are familiar with classical machine learning methods, you can start quantum world with
3. If you are not familiar with both, you are welcome to see _(classical opt & ml)_
4. If you are a beginner in both areas, don't worry, we can start with something easy from here _(math)_!
