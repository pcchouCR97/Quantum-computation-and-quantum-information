# Welcome to Quantum-Cryptography

This is a collection of my learnings and projects on Quantum Computing and Cryptography. This page includes not only just the fundamental of *Quantum Computing* and *Cryptography*, but also give a prerequisite knowledge like Linear Algebra. More we are also discussing the Quantum-Cryptography such as post Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

Last but not least, some `code` examples and projects are also inlcudes for the real life demonstratation.

# Quick Guide:
1. [Cryptography](cryptography/fundamentals.md)
2. [Math Prerequisite](modular/modular_arithmetic.md)
3. [Quantum](quantum/basics.md)
4. [Projects](projects/quantum-simulations.md)

# Mkdocs Troubleshooting:
if error code shows: 

``` py title="ERROR.py"
ERROR   -  Config value 'theme': Unrecognised theme name: 'material'. The available installed themes are: mkdocs, readthedocs
```
Please makesure run the following installation in the terminal

``` py title="python -m pip install mkdocs.py"
python -m pip install mkdocs
```
and
``` py title="python -m pip install mkdocs-material.py"
python -m pip install mkdocs-material
```
