# Welcome to Quantum Optimization and Machine Learning

This is a collection of my learnings and projects on quantum optimization and machine learning. You can start _(Optimization)_ from here and _(Machine Learning)_ from here. But don't worry, I also provide a overview and practical implementation of the classical optimization and machine learning methodoloies.
