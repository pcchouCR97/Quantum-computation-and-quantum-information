# Quantum Computing Basics

Quantum computing is a revolutionary paradigm that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics for computation. Key concepts include:

## Quantum States

A quantum state is represented as a vector in a Hilbert space. For example, a qubit is expressed as:

$$ \lvert \psi \rangle = \alpha \lvert 0 \rangle + \beta \lvert 1 \rangle $$

## Superposition and Entanglement

- **Superposition**: A qubit can exist in a combination of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.
- **Entanglement**: Qubits can correlate their states across distances.
