# Quantum Counting

So the question is how quickly can we determine the number of solutions, $M$, to an $N$ item search problem, if $M$ is not known in advance? Compare with classical computer, which requires $\Theta(N)$ consultations with an oracle to determin $M$, a quantum computer is able to estimate number of solutions much more quickly by combining Fourier transform.
