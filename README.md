# Welcome to Quantum Computation and Quantum Infomation!

This is a collection of my learnings and projects on quantum optimization and machine learning. You can start *(Optimization)* from here and *(Machine Learning)* from here. But don't worry, I also provide a overview and practical implementation of the classical optimization and machine learning methodoloies. 

## Real-World Quantum Applications

### Quantum Phase Estimation

- [Shor's Algorithm](quantum_computation/jupyter_qc/Shor's.ipynb):  
  In this Jupyter notebook, I implemented **Shor’s algorithm from scratch** using only Qiskit’s basic quantum gates — no built-in libraries. Successfully factor $N = 15$.

### Grover Search

*Coming soon!* 

### Quantum Optimization

- [Air Traffic Controller Problem](Projs/jupyter_Opt/(C)Air_Traffic_Control_1_Runway.ipynb):  
  This notebook applies **quantum optimization (VQE)** to a realistic aircraft scheduling problem, considering real aircraft types, wake turbulence, and safety constraints.  
  It demonstrates how quantum algorithms can tackle complex logistics problems — with future potential in operational aviation systems.
